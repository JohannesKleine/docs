##News-Feed
![news feed interface](../img/interface/newsfeed.png "Newsfeed")  

The News Feed displays the last events on your network, 
sorted by the time you received them. 
This gives you a summary of the activity of your friends. 
You can configure which events to show by pressing on [Options](../user-guide/settings/#notify).  

The various events shown are:  

 - Connection attempts (useful to make friends with new people and control who's trying to reach you)
 - Channel and Forum posts
 - New Channel and Forums you can subscribe to 
 - Private messages from your friends

![news feed example](../img/interface/newsfeed/feed.png "Newsfeed Example")  
This shows an entry in the newsfeed because a friend came online, 
and this friend sent a message. 


##Network
![network interface](../img/interface/network.png "Network")  
The Network tab shows your friend RetroShare nodes: the neighbor RetroShare nodes that are connected to you.  
You can group nodes together to allow a finer level of information access, for instance to only allow some nodes to see some of your files. 

On the right, you will find 3 useful tabs:

 - [Broadcast](../user-guide/interface/#broadcast)  
   sends messages to all connected nodes at once
 - [Local network graph](../user-guide/interface/#network-graph)  
   shows the network around you, based on discovery information
 - [Keyring](../user-guide/interface/#keyring)  
   contains node keys you collected, mostly forwarded to you by your friend nodes

![Network](../img/interface/network/redqueen.png "Network RedQueen")  
The Red Queen is having a friend in here Network/Friendlist. 
It's the User Bunny and RedQueen is connected to both of his Locations. 
Bunny runs two different locations. One for each of his device. 
The location *shelter* is running on his laptop, and the location *hole* 
is on his personal Computer. 

###Change Avatar
![Avatar and Message](../img/interface/network/avatar_message.png "Avatar and Message")  
By clicking on the default Avatar Icon you can set your avatar picture 
to any picture you prefer. 

![empty Avatar](../img/interface/network/empty_avatar.png "Empty Avatar")  
Only your friends will be able to see it. You can also change it later on.  

![Change Avatar](../img/interface/network/change_avatar.png "Change Avatar")  

###Status Message
![Status Button](../img/interface/network/status_button.png "Status Button")  
Your status message will be shown in the Network/Friendlist of your friends 
beside your Avatar. 
![Status Edit](../img/interface/network/status_edit.png "Status Edit")  

###Friendlist

Friends are sorted by name or by state. 

![Friendlist](../img/interface/network/friendlist.png "Friendlist")  

The columns with the last contact and ip can be enabled with right click.  
![Tree View](../img/interface/network/tree_view.png "Tree View Option")  

###Broadcast
The Broadcast Chat sends a message to all online friends at once. 
![Broadcast](../img/interface/network/broadcast.png "Broadcast")  

###Network Graph
The network graph shows all friends and their interconnections. 
Bunny has friended with Alice and RedQueen. 
![Graph](../img/interface/network/network_graph.png "Network Graph")  

###Keyring
RetroShare collects keys from other nodes in the network, 
mostly forwarded by friends.  
![Keyring](../img/interface/network/keyring.png "Keyring")  

Columns of the Keyring 

 - Do you accept connections signed by this key  
 - Name of the Key  
 - This column indicates the trust level and wheter you signed their key  
 - Did that peer sign your key  
 - Certificate ID  
 - Last time this certificate has been used
 
 Colours
 
 - Yellow is your own Key  
 - Green are Friends  
 - Grey are Persons  

##People
![people interface](../img/interface/people.png "People")  

Identities are used to securely identify your data: sign messages in chat 
lobbies, forum and channel posts, receive feedback using RetroShare 
built-in email system, post comments after channel posts, 
chat using secured tunnels, etc. 

![person](../img/interface/people/people.png "People")  

###Identities  
Two kinds of Identities can be utilized. 

Click the ![add ID](../img/interface/people/add_id.png "Create New Identity") 
Icon to create a new Identity ![add ID menu](../img/interface/people/add_id_menu.png "Add ID Menu") 

####Pseudonymous Identities
Identities can optionally be signed by your RetroShare node's certificate. 
Signed identities are easier to trust but are easily linked to your node's IP address. 

![pseudo ID create](../img/interface/people/pseudo_id_create.png "Pseudo Identity Create")  

 - Identiy Name  
   Name of the Identity. It is not necessary to use the same name as  
   your Node User. But it's common.  
 - Identity ID  
   Each Identity has it's own crypto hash ID number.  
 - Type  
   Owned by you and linked to your RetroShare Node. Instead of Anonymous  
 - Owner Node ID  
   GPG-ID Number used by your [Node](../user-guide/settings/#public-information)
 - Owner Node Name  
   User Name of your Node User  
 - Last Used  
   Last time the Identity has been in use. This can be a forum post or 
   anything else. 
 - Your opinion  
   Your opininon on your owned ID is Neutral. This is used to rate other ID's for a 
   reputation system. 
 - Auto-Ban all identities from this node  
   Ban all ID's from a specific node. 
 - Neighbor nodes  
   Average opinion of neighbor nodes about this identity. 
   Negative is bad, positive is good. Zero is neutral.
 - Overall  
   Overall reputation score, accounting for yours and your friends'. 
   Negative is bad, positive is good. Zero is neutral. If the score is too 
   low, the identity is flagged as bad, and will be filtered out in forums, 
   chat lobbies, channels, etc. 

![pseudo bunny ID](../img/interface/people/bunny_id.png "Bunny Pseudonymous ID")  

####Anonymous Identities
Anonymous identities allow you to anonymously interact with other users. 
They cannot be spoofed, but noone can prove who really owns a given identity. 

![create freebunny ID](../img/interface/people/create_freebunny.png "Create FreeBunny Anonymous ID") 

 - Identity Name  
   Name of the Identity. Can be named anything. 
 - Identity ID  
   Each Identity has it's own crypto hash ID number.  
 - Type  
   Anonymous identity
 - Last Used  
   Last time the Identity has been in use. This can be a forum post or 
   anything else. 
 - Your opinion  
   Your opininon on your owned ID is Neutral. This is used to rate other ID's for a 
   reputation system. 
 - Neighbor nodes  
   Average opinion of neighbor nodes about this identity. 
   Negative is bad, positive is good. Zero is neutral.
 - Overall  
   Overall reputation score, accounting for yours and your friends'. 
   Negative is bad, positive is good. Zero is neutral. If the score is too 
   low, the identity is flagged as bad, and will be filtered out in forums, 
   chat lobbies, channels, etc.    
 
![freebunny ID](../img/interface/people/freebunny_id.png "FreeBunny ID") 

###Circles
![Circles](../img/interface/people/circles.png "Circles") 

Circles are groups of identities (anonymous or signed), that are shared at a distance over the network. They can be used to restrict the visibility to forums, channels, etc.  
A circle can be restricted to another circle, thereby limiting it's visibility to members of that circle or even self-restricted, meaning that it is only visible to invited members.  

####Create Circles

Click the ![add ID](../img/interface/people/add_id.png "Create New Identity") 
Icon to create a new Identity ![add ID menu](../img/interface/people/add_id_menu.png "Add ID Menu") 

 - ![public circle](../img/interface/people/public_circle.png "Public Circle") Public  
   Publicly distributed circles, are visible to your friends, which 
   will get to know the circle data (Creator, members, etc)
 - ![private Circle](../img/interface/people/private_circle.png "Private Circle")  Private  
   Private (a.k.a. self-restricted) circles are only visible to the 
   invited members of these circles. In practice the circle uses its own list 
   of invited members to limit its own distribution. 
 - ![limit Circle](../img/interface/people/limit_circle.png "Limited to Circle") Only visible to members of another Circle  
   Circles can be restricted to the members of another circle. 
   Only the members of that second circle will be allowed to see the new 
   circle and its contents (list of members, etc).
 - Invited Members  
   Members of this list will be automatically proposed to join the circle (by accepting membership). 
   They will not receive data that is restricted to this circle until they do so. 

The circle name, contact author and invited member list will be visible 
to all invited members. If the cricle is not private, it will also be visible to neighbor nodes 
of the nodes who host the invited members. 

![Umbrella Circles](../img/interface/people/create_umbrella.png "Creating Umbrella Corporation Circle") 

####Join Circles

![Umbrella Circle Empty](../img/interface/people/umbrella_circle_empty.png "Umbrella Circle Without Members")

##File Sharing
![filesharing interface](../img/interface/filesharing.png "File Sharing")  

RetroShare provides two ways of transferring files:

 - direct file transfers from your friends
 - distant anonymous tunneled transfers  
In addition, file transfer is multi-source and allows swarming (you can be source while downloading).  

<a href="../../img/interface/filesharing/up_and_down.png" target="_blank">![up and down](../img/interface/filesharing/up_and_down.png "Up and Downloading")</a>

##Chat Lobbies
![chat-lobbies interface](../img/interface/chat-lobbies.png "Chat Lobbies")  
Chat lobbies are distributed chat rooms, and work pretty much like 
[IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) or 
[XMPP/Jabber](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Messaging_and_Presence_Protocol). 
They allow you to talk anonymously with tons of people without the need to make friends. 
Chatrooms are decentralized and serverless. This means they do not require 
a central server and are shared between direct friends. 
All participants receive all messages. 
Once the lobby is created you can invite other friends from the friends tab. 

###Types of Chat Rooms  
 - Public Chatrooms  
   You can join all chatrooms which are subscribed by your friends.  
   Your friends will be able to join all chatrooms which you have subscribed.  
 - Private Chatrooms  
   This chatrooms is only visible and shared to invited members. 
   Your friends can't see it, unless you invite them. 
   Once you have been invited to a private lobby, 
   you will be able o see it when your friends are using it.  
  
![empty chatrooms](../img/interface/chatrooms/empty_chat.png "Empty Chatrooms")  

###Chat Room Creation

Click the ![add ID](../img/interface/people/add_id.png "Create New Identity") 
Icon to create a new Chat room. 

 - Lobby name  
   The name of the Chatroom. It can't be changed afterwards.  
 - Lobby topic  
   A welcome message in the Lobby room. It can't be changed afterwards.  
 - Identiy to use  
   ![select identity](../img/interface/chatrooms/select_identity.png "Select Identity for Chat")  
   This needs to be one of your identies created in [People](../user-guide/interface/#people)  
 - Visibility  
   ![select visibility](../img/interface/chatrooms/select_visibility.png "Select Visibility of Chatroom")  
   For a list of Chatroom see [Types](../user-guide/interface/#types-of-chat-rooms)
 - Security  
   If you check this, only PGP-signed ids can be used to join and talk in this lobby. 
   This limitation prevents anonymous spamming as it becomes possible 
   for at least some people in the lobby to locate the spammer's node. 
 - Contacts  
   Initially send invitations to online friends of your Node. Only direct 
   friends can join with their Identities. 

![chatroom creation](../img/interface/chatrooms/create_chat.png "Chatroom Creation")

![Context Menu Chat ID](../img/interface/chatrooms/menu_chat_id.png "Right Click Menu Chat ID")


##Messages
![messages interface](../img/interface/messages.png "Messages")  
RetroShare has its own internal email system. You can send/receive emails to/from connected friend nodes.  

It is also possible to send messages to other people's Identities using the global routing system. These messages are always encrypted and signed, and are relayed by intermediate nodes until they reach their final destination. 

Distant messages stay into your Outbox untial an acknowledgment of receipt has been received. 

Generally, you mey use messages to recommended files to your friends by pasting file links, or recommend friend nodes to other friend nodes, in order to strenghten your networ, or send feedback to a channel's owner. 


##Channels
![channels interface](../img/interface/channels.png "Channels")  
Channels allow you to post data (e.g. movies, music) that will spread the network. 

You can see the channels your friends are subscribed to, and you automatically forward subscribed channels to your friends. 
This promotes good channels in the network. 

Only the channel's creator can post on that channel. Other peers in the 
network can only read from it, unless the channel is private. You can 
however share the posting rights or the reading rights with friend RetroShare nodes. 

Channels can be made anonymous, or attached to a RetroShare identity so 
that readers can contact you if needed. Enable "Allow Comments" if you 
want to let users comment on your posts. 

Channel posts get deleted after 4 months. 

###Create a Channel
When RetroShare starts, there are no Channels available initially. 
![Channels interface](../img/interface/channels/no_channels.png "Empty Channels")  

To Create a new Channel click on the 
![Create Channel](../img/interface/channels/create_channel.png "Create Channel")

    - ![public Forum](../img/interface/channels/network-public.png "Public Forum") Public  
      Message will spread way beyond your friend nodes, as long as people 
      subscribe to the channel/forum/posted you're creating. 
    - ![Circle Restricted Forum](../img/interface/channels/circles.png "Circle Restricted Forum") Restricted to Circle  
      Message will spread among RetroShare nodes that host one of the 
      identities listed as member of the circle and who also subscribe the media. 
      Only these nodes will be able to see that this forum/channel/posted media exists. 
    - ![Network Forum](../img/interface/channels/network.png "Only Friends Forum") Only For Your Friends  
      Messages will only be distributed to the selected subset of your 
      friend nodes. They will not forward messages with each other, but 
      only use your own node as a central hub to distribute them. 
 - Description  
 - Comments 
    - Allow Comments  
    - No Comments  

![New Channel](../img/interface/channels/new_channel.png "Empty new Channel")

##Forums

RetroShare Forums look like internet forums, but they work in a decentralized way. 

<a href="../../img/interface/forums/empty_forum.png" target="_blank">![empty forums](../img/interface/forums/empty_forum.png "Empty Forums")</a>  

You see forums your friends are subscribed to, and you forward subscribed forums to your friends. 
This automatically promotes interresting forums in the network. 
Forum messages get deleted after 12 months.

####Forum Message Distribution

 - ![public Forum](../img/interface/forums/network-public.png "Public Forum") Public  
   Message will spread way beyond your friend nodes, as long as people 
   subscribe to the channel/forum/posted you're creating. 
 - ![Circle Restricted Forum](../img/interface/forums/circles.png "Circle Restricted Forum") Restricted to Circle  
   Message will spread among RetroShare nodes that host one of the 
   identities listed as member of the circle and who also subscribe the media. 
   Only these nodes will be able to see that this forum/channel/posted media exists. 
 - ![Network Forum](../img/interface/forums/network.png "Only Friends Forum") Only For Your Friends  
   Messages will only be distributed to the selected subset of your 
   friend nodes. They will not forward messages with each other, but 
   only use your own node as a central hub to distribute them.
